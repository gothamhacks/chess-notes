# gothamhacks/chessboards

Welcome to the collection.

Inside this repo you’ll find a series of `.txt` files.  
Each one is a chessboard position. That’s all we’ll say.

This repository was cloned from an old profile belonging to a speed chess addict.  
Some say they saw the board differently.  
Some say they *felt* things others didn’t.

Were the games real?  
Was it a pattern?  
Or just madness and memory, rendered in 8x8?
